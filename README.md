# Sonar Data Classification using Logistic Regression

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of logistic regression to classify sonar data into two categories: Mine (M) and Rock (R). The dataset used contains various features (attributes) that are indicative of the type of object detected by sonar.

## Dependencies
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sonar-classification.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd sonar-classification
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the `SONAR01.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to execute the code.
3. The notebook will guide you through the following steps:
    - Importing necessary libraries.
    - Loading and exploring the dataset.
    - Data preprocessing and splitting into training and test sets.
    - Training a logistic regression model.
    - Evaluating the model's performance on training and test data.
    - Making predictions on new data.

## Features
- Data loading and exploration.
- Data preprocessing.
- Model training and evaluation.
- Prediction on new data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is named `sonar data.csv`. It contains 208 rows and 61 columns, where the last column (60) represents the target variable (M for Mine, R for Rock).

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
